## Codify your Smart Home

The idea consist of a multi-level mini-game where the user have to build a flowchart consisting
of a right sequence of pre-generated simple housekeeping actions.

Upon successful completion, every action would show it's equivalent pseudocode, the idea being that
the user would learn the basics of coding by comparison. If the user failed to create the correct
sequence, a playful error message would be displayed instead.

The game was made using [Konva.js](https://konvajs.github.io/)
